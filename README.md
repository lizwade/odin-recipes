This is a project to give me practice using the basics of html, zsh and git that I've just learned.
If you're reading this, then I have successfully created a README file in the terminal, edited it with VSCode,
gone through the git processes of staging and committing it, and pushed it to github.
(Hopefully those terms are approximately correct.)
The same goes for all the html pages too - and in addition they hopefully deliver a functional, if humble, website.
