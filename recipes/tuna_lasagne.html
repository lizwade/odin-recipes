        <li>200g grated three cheese blend (ideally cheddar, mozzarella and parmesan)</li>
        <li>5-6 lasagne sheets</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 190°C/170°C fan. Lightly grease a 19 x 25cm (base measurement) baking dish. Heat the oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, courgette and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes or until soft. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomato, passata, and oregano. Season. Add the tuna and gently fold to combine.</li>
        <li>Combine the ricotta, lemon rind and egg in a bowl. Season with salt and stir until smooth. Add half the grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the base of the prepared dish with a layer of lasagne sheets, trimming to fit. Spread one-third of the tuna mixture over, then top with another layer of lasagne sheets. Repeat with the remaining tuna mixture and lasagne sheets, finishing with a layer of lasagne sheets.</li>
        <li>Spread the ricotta mixture over the top of the lasagne. Sprinkle with parsley leaves and the remaining grated cheese. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until golden. Set aside for 10 minutes to cool slightly before serving.</li>
